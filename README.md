# Tech 201 Infrastructure as Code

## What is Infrastructure as Code? (IaC)
Infrastructure as Code is the managing and provisioning of IT infrastructure through code as opposed to manual processes.
With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distrubute configurations.

## Why should we use IaC?
Provisioning infrastructure has historically been a time consuming and costly manual process. Adopting a code-based approach makes it easier for organisations to do more in less time.
